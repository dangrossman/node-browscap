This library is no longer actively maintained. I will not be accepting any issues or pull requests. In the 5+ years since it was written, management of the source browscap.ini files changed and the characteristics of the data they provide changed significantly. In my own projects, I now use [ua-parser](https://github.com/tobie/ua-parser) which has libraries available in many languages. 

# Introduction

node-browscap is a port of PHP's get_browser function to node.js

It makes available a `getBrowser` function which takes a browser user agent string 
and returns an associative array of properties and abilities of that browser.

You must provide a browscap.ini file, which you can get here:

http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp

Both the browscap.ini or php_browscap.ini files should work.

Example:

	var browscap = require('browscap');
	browscap.setIni('./browscap.ini');

	var browser = browscap.getBrowser("Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 5.1; Trident/4.0; WinTSI 05.11.2009)");

	//Will print "IE 8.0"
	console.log(browser['Browser'] + " " + browser['Version']);

Thanks to [torvalamo](http://github.com/torvalamo) for some rewrites to 
improve performance.

# Installation

Using npm run `npm install browscap`

You can get npm from http://npmjs.org/

# Examples

There is a test.js file which demonstrates how to use node-browscap and tests
several user agents.
